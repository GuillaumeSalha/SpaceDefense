# SpaceDefense---Project

"Space Defense" is a little Shoot'Em Up/Tower Defense video game, created by Gautier Appert and myself. It was our C++ project, in the framework of our second year as ENSAE ParisTech students. We used Qt for this project.

If you directly want to play : download the SpaceDefenseGame.zip file, unzip it and click on SPACEDEFENSE.exe in the release file (only for Windows).

If you want to check the C++/Qt source code : take a look at SpaceDefenseCode.
